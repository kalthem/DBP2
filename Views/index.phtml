  <p class="lead">
    Borrow My Charger is a community-driven electric vehicle (EV) charger rental platform that connects EV owners with local homeowners who have private charge points.
    Our goal is to make EV charging more accessible and convenient for everyone — especially in areas where public charging stations are limited.
  </p>
  <p>
    Homeowners can earn passive income by listing their available charging points, while EV drivers can search, book, and charge in nearby neighborhoods — saving time, money, and stress.
  </p>
  <p>
    The platform supports:
    <ul>
      <li>Location-based charge point search with filters</li>
      <li>Role-based access for Admins, Homeowners, and Users</li>
      <li>Booking management with approval workflows</li>
      <li>Google Maps integration for interactive browsing</li>
      <li>Secure login, password encryption, and performance optimization</li>
    </ul>
