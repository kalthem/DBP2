                <strong>Borrow My Charger</strong> is a community-driven platform designed to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers
                find and book available charging points hosted by local homeowners. Whether you're on a trip or simply need
                a quick charge nearby, our network connects EV owners with reliable charging options.

                By allowing homeowners to share their private EV chargers, we’re making charging more accessible, reducing range
                anxiety, and helping people earn passive income — all while supporting a greener future.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe in sustainable transport, sharing economy, and user-friendly technology that makes everyday life easier.
